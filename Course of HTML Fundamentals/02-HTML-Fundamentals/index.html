    All modern websites and web applications are built using three
    <em>fundamental</em> technologies: HTML, CSS and
    JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.</p>

    <h3>What is HTML ?</h3>
    <p>
    HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content
     of a webpage (not a programming language).

    <p>
    HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
    </p>
    <p> 
    In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>The opening tag</li>
        <li>The closing tag</li>
        <li>he actual element</li>
    </ol>
